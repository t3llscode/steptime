# StepTime

## A maintime.io Initiative

There are companies out there that capitalize on something as simple as a tool to compare physical fitness efforts. Specifically targeted towards companies with high budgets, the amount of money demanded for these services is simply outrageous. This is why I started to build StepTime as a fully free extension to my Time Management App maintime that - same as StepTime - tries to help you to get the best version of yourself.

Health data is especially valuable. This is why everything except the team data, the amount and the date of the steps will be encrypted by a key that is only hold by the team members and is neither created by nor send to the server. This allows to fully avoid unencrypted personal data.
